Programming Assignment 3 - UI

Commands to run program: g++ src/chatbot.cpp src/contactInformation.cpp src/personalInformation.cpp
                        ./a.out

In this portion of the programming assignment, the goal was to handle a user input, find the information
that the user wants, and then make that information available in the command line. In order to do this,
I used four separate folders: data, doc, src, and test.

The data folder just contains input.txt which is where the information extracted from the representative's
website is. There is no need for an output file now because the information is available in the command line.

The doc folder contains description.txt and the UML diagram. These two are used to understand what the program
is meant to do and how it should be run.

The src folder currently contains a lot of files, but the only ones currently being used in the program are
chatbot.cpp, contactInformation.cpp and .h, personalInformation.cpp and .h. The other ones are ones that I am
working on to extract other information like committees and voting records but they aren't done yet. The chatbot.cpp
file takes in the user input and processes it to determine what the user is asking for. It determines the key word
then calls either contactInformation.cpp or personal.cpp to process it further and output a response. This loop runs
until the user types Quit, quit, or q. The output contains both the users original input and the programs output.

The test folder just contains a.out because I use this in testing.
