 * 
 * Note: all data members are public (anyone can edit)
 * 
 * Classes and Objects
 * Class : a well defined concept
 *      - physical or abstract
 *      - ex : People, Students, Lectures, Dreams
 * Object : an instance of a class
 *      - ex : People : US-President, Dalai Lama, R2D2
 * 
 * Why objects/ classes?
 * - ease of writing and understanding code
 * - easier to test
 * - no impact on executional performance
 * - c++ concepts
 *      - struct
 *      - class (object oriented programming)
 * - encapsulation
 * - abstraction
 * - separation of concerns
 * - drive code reuse
 * 
 * Class : general concept that has properties that all instances share
 *      - data members
 *      - functions
 * Object : specific instances
 *      - reuse definitions of data members(variables) and methods of class
 *      - data types and values of the member variables can be cast/ updated
