In this portion of the programming assignment, the goal was to handle an utterance from the user, process the utterance,
and match the utterance with the proper response from the chatbot which would be available in the command line. The
program uses a continuous while loop to continue until the user inputs q, Quit, or quit. In order to do this,
I used four separate folders: data, doc, src, and test.

The data folder just contains input.txt which is where the information extracted from the representative's
website is. There is no need for an output file now because the information is available in the command line.

The doc folder contains description.txt and was used to understand what the program is meant to do and 
how it should be run.

The src folder contains chatbot.cpp. This program takes in a prompted utterance from the user and processes it into a
vector. Likewise, it reads from a text file and processes the matching buzzwords into a vector and leaves the response
as a string. Then the two vectors were compared to search for word matches and the lines with the most matches were
outputted to the user.

The test folder contains test.txt which holds the output of the test phrases listed on blackboard.
