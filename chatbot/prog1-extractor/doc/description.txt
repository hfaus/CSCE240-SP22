The code contained in this folder is the code that I have written for the chatbot project for CSCE 240 - Spring 2022.
Currently, I am only on Project 1 - which entails being able to process the given text file for information.
I have designated three folders within the project folder to house my code as well as other viable pieces of information.

The first one is the data folder. This folder contains SCLegislature.txt which houses the information parsed in my main code.
The information within SCLegislature.txt was obtained from the website https://www.scstatehouse.gov/member.php?code=1905681590
and then was converted from html to txt. There were slight edits made to make it easier to read (taking out some of the
untranslated characters, etc.)

The second one is the src folder. This folder contains chatbot.cpp, which is my main code, and is able to access the given text
file and parse through looking for key words. I compared my representative to other representative files and chose words that
would allow this file to be exchanged to fit other profiles. Currently, there is only the main() method and a void read() function.
The read() function opens the text file and parses through it to find and save the relevant information. This can be shown through
the information being read out to the command line. The main() method only calls the read() function.

The third one is the doc folder. This folder contains the README.md file and the description.txt file that I am currently writing on.
